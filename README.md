# DeadByDaylightBOT
Simple bot for Dead by Daylight, useful to farm bloodpoints with the Wraith


# How to
Just launch the bot.exe file as administrator, when in game select the Wraith as killer and position your mouse on the "Create a lobby" button, press F8 to start the bot. That's it!

Please make sure you have default key bindings in game options; bot uses left and right click for primary and secondary actions.

If you want to stop the bot press F8 again. To pause or close the script look in your taskbar for a green "H" button.

This bot is created to maximize the bloodpoints with the Wraith, it was never tested with other killers.

IMPORTANT: never move the mouse away from the bottom right position! This is important to recreate a lobby after exiting a game. Move yourself away from the chair instead :)
